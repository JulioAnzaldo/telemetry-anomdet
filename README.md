## Overview
TADT aims to simplify the pipeline of:

- Ingesting heterogeneous telemetry
- Running unsupervised anomaly detection
- Visualizing results via Streamlight dashboard
- Extracting features (statistical, spectral, rolling window)
- Applying preprocessing (resampling, noise filtering, interpolation)

## System requirements

1. MacOS, Linux, or Windows with WSL
2. [git](https://git-scm.com/)
3. [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), and [PIP](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)
