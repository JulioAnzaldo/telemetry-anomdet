Applications in CubeSat Operations
==================================

This toolkit can be integrated into CubeSat missions for:
    Real-time anomaly detection in ground telemetry streams
    Early fault detection (battery, thermal, comms)
    Automated data flagging for post pass analysis

Planned compatibility with open ground systems like Yamcs, COSMOS, and Open MCT.
